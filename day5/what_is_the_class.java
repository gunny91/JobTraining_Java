	/**
	 * 
	 * How to make a class?
	 * 
	 * variables + method + constructor
	 * 
	 * step1
	 *  class name{
	 * 
	 * 	private int name;
	 * 	private boolean isIt;
	 * 	
	 * 	public name(){} // constructor
	 * 
	 * 	public int getter(){}
	 * 	public void setter(){}
	 * 	
	 * step2
	 * class name = new constructor name();
	 * The class name is same as constructor's name
	 * 
	 * step3 : Assign the value to variables
	 *  . : operator of member assignment
	 * 	objectname.variable = value; //writer
	 * 	syso(object.variable); //reader
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Variable : store the value
	 * property
	 * 
	 * Method : Behavior of procedure
	 *
	 *
	 * Inner Class's variable = Member variable = instance variable
	 * Instance variable = they have a reset value.
	 *	Integer =0;
	 * 	String =null;
	 * 	Double =0.0;
	 * 	Class type =null;
	 * 	Boolean =false;
	 * 	
	 * 
	 * Local variable : Inner method and it declared at the inner method
	 * Must reset the value to get the new value
	 * 
	 * Static = class variable or static variable
	 * Static: Static variable then the "static String bankName =null;"
	 * 		   Load first at the memory before the main method.
	 * 		   Share with object
	 *		   add the static keyword, also defined into class.
	 *		   The initial value is same as instance variable.
	 * 		   It is possible to access to class name		
	 * 
	 * Stack : Stack the objects=reference variables, developer can access to it.
	 *  Heap : Developer cannot access to it. Instance variables place on it.
	 *  new  : 1. Create the instance variables at heap
	 *  	   2. Reference between object and instance variables
	 *  	   3. Call the constructor (special method to reset the instance variables)
	 * 
	 * Math: Every method is static method.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * What is the constructor
	 * 	It is initiate the Instance variable or pre-provide the something work.
	 * Constructor : - Invisible constructor (default)
	 * 				 - Visible constructor (kind of method) Developer need to type in.
	 * 
	 * public name(para )  //constructor's name should be same as class's name
	 * {
	 * 		something
	 * }
	 * 
	 * }
